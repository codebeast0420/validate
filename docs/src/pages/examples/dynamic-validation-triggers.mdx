# Dynamic validation triggers

In previous versions of vee-validate you could configure what events trigger the validation based on the field state. This feature was called "interaction modes". In vee-validate v4 this feature was removed because it is now possible to implement it with the composition API.

This example should help you figure out how to migrate this feature from older vee-validate versions.
