# Custom Checkboxes

Checkboxes are more complex than regular text inputs, because there is always two states to keep track of which can be confusing at first. Mainly you should keep track of:

- Each individual input's value
- Which inputs are current selected

To make this easier, remember that native checkboxes behave as a group while each input maintains it's own value. Then a checkbox said to be checked when either:

- It's value is the one currently selected
- It's value is included in the ones selected

This is because of the nature of checkboxes behaving as **"multi-value"** form inputs, so you need to keep track of each input's value and the currently selected one(s).

With all of that in mind, vee-validate offers simple abstractions for checkboxes. You can build your own checkboxes with vee-validate's `useField` function which gives you the full capabilities of validation in a composable fashion.

Because `useField` isn't aware of what kind of input will be composed with it, you will need to specify that the input is of type `checkbox` and pass a `checkedValue` as well which represents that single field's value. By doing so, you gain access to `checked` prop which tells you if the checkbox should be selected.

```js
import { toRef } from 'vue';
import { useField } from 'vee-validate';

export default {
  props: {
    // The group's value
    modelValue: {
      type: null,
    },
    // Field's own value
    value: {
      type: null,
    },
    name: {
      type: String,
    },
    rules: {
      type: String,
      default: undefined,
    },
  },
  setup(props) {
    // Must use `toRef` to make the checkboxes names reactive
    const { checked, handleChange } = useField(toRef(props.name), props.rules, {
      // ðŸ‘‡ These are important
      type: 'checkbox',
      checkedValue: props.value,
    });

    // select/unselect the input
    handleChange(props.value);

    return {
      checked, // readonly
      handleChange,
    };
  },
};
```

vee-validate handles some of the complexities of the checkbox inputs nature, by default if a checkbox field is registered it will be treated as a single input until another checkbox with the same name is registered. Then they will be treated as a group, and their values will affect the group value when they are selected or not.

Here is a live example of a custom checkbox input:

<LiveExample client:visible id="vee-validate-v4-custom-checkboxes" />

You can also specify a custom `uncheckedValue` which sets the input value to when it is unchecked.

```js
const { checked, handleChange } = useField('toa', undefined, {
  // Will make the checkbox set its value to true/false if it was checked or not
  type: 'checkbox',
  checkedValue: true,
  uncheckedValue: false,
});
```
